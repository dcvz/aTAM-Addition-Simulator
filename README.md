aTAM Addition Simulator
======

This simulator was built in ~24 hours for [HackTX](http://hacktx.com) in 2014. It is based on the addition algorithm proposed in the paper: *[Fast Arithmetic in Algorithmic Self-Assembly](http://arxiv-web3.library.cornell.edu/abs/1303.2416)*.

You can find a demo [here](http://dchavez.net/misc/hacktx2014/).
